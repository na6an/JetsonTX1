# Running Lidar on Jetson TX1

## Background
Lidar became a famous sensor since the self-driving cars earned popularity.  
However, it is usually very expensive; Commercial lidars cost thousands.  
Even some non-commercial, short-distance lidars easily cost hundreds.
Because of this pricing, it's not easy for amateur hobbysts and robotists to buy one and play around.

Neato is a company known for its robot vacuums attaching a lidar.  
The range of this lidar on the robot vacuums is relatively short, up to 10m, but is much cheaper.
